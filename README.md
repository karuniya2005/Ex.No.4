**DATE:** 03-09-2025 

**REGISTER NUMBER:** 212223240068


## üéØ Aim  
To design an **AI-powered chatbot** that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone.  

In this experiment, we employ different **prompt patterns** to guide chatbot development, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.  

**Case Study 1:** Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, and Preceding Question Prompting.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure  

### 1. Define the Scenario and Use Case  
- **Scenario:**  
  The manufacturing industry seeks to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.  

- **Target Audience:**  
  Manufacturing companies (automotive, electronics, food processing) where automation can significantly improve productivity.  

- **Main Objectives:**  
  - Improve production efficiency by **30%**  
  - Minimize downtime using **predictive maintenance**  
  - Enable **real-time monitoring** & remote control  
  - Reduce **energy consumption** via optimization

### 2. Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect  

#### a) Idea Generation Prompts  
**Prompt:**  
> ‚ÄúWhat features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?‚Äù  

**Generated Ideas:**  
- Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance  
- Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures  
- Energy usage optimization (automated switching based on demand)  
- Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring & control  

#### b) Tabular Format Prompting  
**Prompt:**  
> ‚ÄúCreate a table comparing different types of sensors for a manufacturing environment. Include Sensor Type, Use Case, Cost, and Maintenance Frequency.‚Äù  

**Generated Table:**  

| Sensor Type       | Use Case                                | Cost   | Maintenance Frequency |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Vibration Sensor  | Predictive maintenance (motor health)   | High   | Low                    |
| Temperature Sensor| Overheating alerts, energy efficiency   | Low    | Very Low               |
| Current Sensor    | Power consumption monitoring            | Medium | Low                    |

#### c) Preceding Question Prompting  
**Prompt:**  
> ‚ÄúWhat should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?‚Äù  

**Generated Context:**  
- The interface should be **intuitive**, providing real-time data on performance, energy usage, and alerts.  
- It must convey **reliability** and **ease of use**, requiring minimal training for operators.  



## ‚úÖ Conclusion  

The integration of **AI-powered automation systems**, guided by structured prompting, demonstrates significant potential to:  
- **Improve efficiency** by 30%  
- **Reduce downtime** with predictive maintenance  
- **Enable real-time monitoring** & remote control  
- **Enhance energy efficiency** through optimization  



## üîë Role of Prompt Patterns  

- **Straightforward Prompts:** Enabled rapid ideation (IoT sensors, predictive analytics).  
- **Tabular Format Prompting:** Structured priorities and trade-offs (cost vs. functionality).  
- **Preceding Question Prompting:** Defined contextual needs (intuitive UI for operators).  

## üìå Key Outcomes  

- **Feature Set:** Real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy optimization, remote dashboards.  
- **User-Centric Design:** Simple UI requiring minimal training.  
- **Scalability:** Modular cloud-based system adaptable to multiple industries.
